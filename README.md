# Personal-Project-4---MyPaper-Accounts-Receivable-

Project Brief: MyPaper is a paper supplier. The company supplies paper locally to businesses. 
They allow customers to buy paper upfront but also have a credit option. This is 
where they supply customers with paper, and the customer doesnâ€™t pay an 
amount upfront but will make frequent smaller payments.
MyPaper wants to do a full recon of their accounts receivable. 

The Finance manager would like to select a customer and view some details like:

1. Amount the customer has paid each month
2. Average Days Overdue (on average, how many days is the customer late 
by?)
3. List of invoices and amounts by the customer
4. Number of times the customer has disputed invoiced.
